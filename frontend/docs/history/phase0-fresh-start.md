# Phase 0: Fresh Start

**Date**: January 2026
**Status**: Complete ✅
**Impact**: Major architectural reset

## Overview

Phase 0 was a strategic reset of the Neo Alexandria frontend, clearing out incomplete features and establishing a clear 8-phase roadmap based on the "Second Brain" vision from the whitepaper.

## What Happened

### The Problem

The frontend had accumulated several partially-implemented features:
- Incomplete search interface
- Partial recommendations UI
- Fragmented resource management
- Inconsistent component patterns
- No clear architectural direction

**Decision**: Clean slate approach - preserve only authentication, rebuild everything else with a clear plan.

### The Solution

1. **Preserve Core Auth**: Keep all authentication code working
2. **Remove Incomplete Features**: Delete partial implementations
3. **Create 8-Phase Roadmap**: Define clear path forward
4. **Add UI MCP Servers**: Leverage AI for component generation
5. **Define Implementation Options**: Three approaches per phase

## What Was Preserved

### Authentication System ✅
- Login page and OAuth flow
- Token management
- Auth provider and context
- Protected route wrapper (`_auth.tsx`)
- API client with auth headers
- **OAuth2 Google/GitHub integration** (configured and working)

### Backend Configuration ✅
- **API Base URL**: `https://pharos.onrender.com` (configured in `frontend/.env`)
- OAuth2 credentials already set up
- All auth endpoints working

### Base Infrastructure ✅
- Project configuration (Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- Build tooling
- Testing setup (Vitest, React Testing Library)
- Base UI components (will be enhanced)

### File Structure
```
frontend/src/
├── features/auth/          ✅ Kept
├── routes/
│   ├── __root.tsx          ✅ Kept
│   ├── _auth.tsx           ✅ Kept
│   ├── login.tsx           ✅ Kept
│   └── auth.callback.tsx   ✅ Kept
├── app/providers/
│   └── AuthProvider.tsx    ✅ Kept
├── core/api/
│   └── client.ts           ✅ Kept
└── components/ui/          ✅ Kept (to be enhanced)
```

## What Was Removed

### Incomplete Features ❌
- `src/features/search/` - Partial search implementation
- `src/features/recommendations/` - Incomplete recommendations
- `src/features/resources/` - Fragmented resource management
- `src/features/monitoring/` - Basic monitoring UI

### Old Routes ❌
- `src/routes/_auth.dashboard.tsx`
- `src/routes/_auth.resources.tsx`
- `src/routes/_auth.search.tsx`
- `src/routes/index.tsx`

### Old Components ❌
- `src/components/layout/` - Old layout system

### Old Specs ❌
- `.kiro/specs/frontend/phase2-discovery-search/` - Outdated spec

## The New 8-Phase Roadmap

### Philosophy: "Second Brain" for Code

A dual-head architecture combining:
- **Dashboard**: Visual workspace for exploration
- **MCP Client**: Headless tools for IDE integration

### The 8 Phases

| Phase | Name | Focus | Status |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Core Workbench & Navigation | Foundation layout | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Living Code Editor | Monaco + intelligence | 📋 Planned |
| 3 | Living Library | PDF management | 📋 Planned |
| 4 | Cortex/Knowledge Base | Visual graph + LBD | 📋 Planned |
| 5 | Implementation Planner | AI-powered planning | 📋 Planned |
| 6 | Unified RAG Interface | Split-pane search | 📋 Planned |
| 7 | Ops & Edge Management | System health | 📋 Planned |
| 8 | MCP Client Integration | IDE ghost interface | 📋 Planned |

### Three Implementation Options Per Phase

**Option A: Clean & Fast** ⭐⭐
- Minimalist, VS Code-inspired
- shadcn-ui focused
- Keyboard-first
- Fast to implement

**Option B: Rich & Visual** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Glassmorphism, animated
- magic-ui focused
- Mouse-friendly
- Impressive but complex

**Option C: Hybrid Power** ⭐⭐⭐ ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- Professional with strategic polish
- Leverages all 3 MCP servers
- Balanced approach
- Best of both worlds

## UI MCP Servers Added

### 1. shadcn-ui MCP Server
**Package**: `@jpisnice/shadcn-ui-mcp-server`
**Purpose**: Core UI primitives
**Components**: Button, Card, Dialog, Command, Sheet, etc.

### 2. magic-ui MCP Server
**Package**: `@magicuidesign/mcp`
**Purpose**: Animations and effects
**Components**: Animated text, particles, spotlight, orbiting circles

### 3. magic-mcp
**Package**: `@21st-dev/magic-mcp`
**Purpose**: AI component generation
**Use**: Generate initial component structures

### Configuration

Added to `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shadcn-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jpisnice/shadcn-ui-mcp-server"]
    },
    "magic-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@magicuidesign/mcp"]
    },
    "magic-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@21st-dev/magic-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Decisions

### Why Clean Slate?

**Pros**:
- Clear architectural direction
- No technical debt
- Modern best practices
- Consistent patterns

**Cons**:
- Lost some working code
- Need to rebuild features
- Temporary feature gap

**Verdict**: Worth it for long-term maintainability

### Why 8 Phases?

**Rationale**:
- Incremental delivery
- Clear dependencies
- Manageable scope
- Testable milestones

**Benefits**:
- Each phase delivers value
- Can adjust based on feedback
- Parallel development possible
- Clear progress tracking

### Why Three Options?

**Flexibility**:
- Different complexity levels
- Different visual styles
- Different time investments
- User can choose based on priorities

**Recommendation**:
- Option C (Hybrid Power) for most phases
- Option A (Clean & Fast) for simpler phases (Ops, Planner)
- Option B (Rich & Visual) rarely recommended (too complex)
