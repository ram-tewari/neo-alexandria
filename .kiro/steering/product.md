## Non-Goals

### What We Are NOT Building

❌ **Social Network** - No user profiles, followers, or social features
❌ **Content Creation Platform** - No authoring tools or publishing workflows
❌ **File Storage Service** - No general-purpose file hosting
❌ **Real-time Collaboration** - No simultaneous editing or live cursors
❌ **Mobile Apps** - Web-first, responsive design only
❌ **Enterprise SSO** - Simple authentication only
❌ **Multi-tenancy** - Single-user or small team focus
❌ **Blockchain/Web3** - Traditional database architecture
❌ **Video/Audio Processing** - Text and document focus only

## Product Principles

1. **API-First** - All features accessible via RESTful API
2. **Privacy-Focused** - User data stays local or self-hosted
3. **Open Source** - Transparent, extensible, community-driven
4. **Performance** - Fast response times (<200ms for most operations)
5. **Simplicity** - Clean interfaces, minimal configuration
6. **Extensibility** - Plugin architecture for custom features

## Success Metrics

- **Search Quality**: nDCG > 0.7 for hybrid search
- **Response Time**: P95 < 200ms for API endpoints
- **Classification Accuracy**: > 85% for ML taxonomy
- **User Satisfaction**: Qualitative feedback from early adopters
- **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for self-hosted deployments
