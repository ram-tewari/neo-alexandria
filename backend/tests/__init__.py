"""
Anti-Gaslighting Test Suite

This test suite uses Golden Data (immutable JSON files) to decouple test
expectations from test logic, preventing AI assistants from "fixing" tests
by changing assertions when features are broken.

All code is built from scratch with no dependencies on legacy test infrastructure.
