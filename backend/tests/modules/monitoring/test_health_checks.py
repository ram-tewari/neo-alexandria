Monitoring Module Health Check Integration Tests

Tests the health check endpoints for all modules in the system.
Verifies that each module's health endpoint returns 200 OK and
follows the expected response format.

Also tests the enhanced health check endpoint that verifies:
- Database connectivity
- Redis connectivity
- Celery worker status
