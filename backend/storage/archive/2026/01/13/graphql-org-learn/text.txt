Then move on to best practices for designing better APIs. Start with the basics What will you find here? Learn GraphQL Tutorials Best Practices FAQ Lesson 1 Introduction Get a high-level overview of GraphQL and how it enables flexible, versionless APIs powered by a strong type system. Lesson 2 Schemas and Types Learn how GraphQL’s schema language defines the shape of your data using types. Lesson 3 Queries Understand how to structure GraphQL queries to request exactly the data you need — including fields, variables and fragments. Lesson 4 Mutations Explore how to modify data with mutations, including how to update and remove records through your schema. Lesson 5 Subscriptions Discover how GraphQL supports real-time data with subscriptions and how to use them effectively at scale. Lesson 6 Validation See how GraphQL ensures query correctness through validation rules and how common errors are detected early. Lesson 7 Execution Learn how resolvers power GraphQL execution and how the server processes and returns data for each query. Lesson 8 Response Explore how GraphQL structures its responses, including data, errors and extensions for custom metadata. Lesson 9 Introspection Use introspection to explore the schema itself — a powerful way to inspect types and fields dynamically.
