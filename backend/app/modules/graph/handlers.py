Graph Event Handlers

Emits graph-related events for knowledge graph updates and discoveries.
Subscribes to resource.chunked events for automatic graph extraction.

Events Emitted:
- citation.extracted: When citations are extracted from a resource
- graph.updated: When the knowledge graph is updated
- hypothesis.discovered: When a new hypothesis is discovered via LBD
- graph.entity_extracted: When entities are extracted from a chunk
- graph.relationship_extracted: When relationships are extracted

Events Subscribed:
- resource.chunked: Triggers automatic graph extraction if enabled
